Rotary-CPT: A Timing-Based Continuous Performance Test

Overview

Rotary-CPT is a novel Continuous Performance Test (CPT) designed to assess sustained attention, impulsivity, distractibility, vigilance, and hyperactivity using a continuous, timing-based response paradigm. Unlike traditional CPTs that rely on discrete stimuli, Rotary-CPT employs a rotating pointer and time-critical response window, emphasizing temporal monitoring and response inhibition.

Task Description

Participants observe a pointer rotating around a circular dial. On each trial, a response window appears:
	•	Go trials: a valid window appears; participants must click while the pointer is within the window.
	•	No-Go trials: an invalid window appears; participants must withhold responding.

Reaction time is defined relative to the moment the pointer enters the response window, enabling precise measurement of anticipatory and delayed responses. Trial timing includes jittered inter-trial intervals to prevent rhythmic responding.

Experimental Structure

The test lasts approximately 18–20 minutes and consists of four blocks:
	1.	High Go frequency (80%) – assesses impulsivity and inhibitory control
	2.	Low Go frequency (20%) – assesses vigilance to rare targets
	3.	Distractor block – introduces visual or auditory distractors to measure distractibility
	4.	Sustained block – examines performance decline over time

Outcome Measures
	•	Sustained Attention: omission rate, reaction time variability, time-on-task decline
	•	Impulsivity: commission errors, anticipatory responses
	•	Distractibility: performance cost during and after distractors
	•	Vigilance: rare-target hit rate, vigilance decrement, signal detection indices
	•	Hyperactivity: task-irrelevant mouse movement and excess responses

Significance

Rotary-CPT provides a unified, sensitive, and easily implementable framework for assessing attentional control and behavioral regulation, suitable for both research and screening applications.
